The goal of this project was to design and implement my own concurrent stock server.
It is built in two approaches, event and thread based.

Basic flow and its interpretation is based on
- Computer Systems : A Programmer's Perspective, by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron

It is bundled with a stock_generator code, which generates a stock.txt file.
